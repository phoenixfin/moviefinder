# Movie Finder

This is a very simple app to find a movie from database.

## Overview

The app is utilizing [The Movie Database API] (http://www.themoviedb.org) as a resource to find the movie.
To access the app, visit the [github page] (https://github.com/phoenixfin/moviefinder).
A basic triadic HTML-CSS-Javascript development framework is used, with some supporting tools from node packages.
The whole script is bundled using Webpack module.

## Getting Started

1. Modify any code needed in `builder/src` directory.
2. Readjust the webpack configuration in `builder/config` directory if neccessary.
3. Rebuild the app, using command
`npm run build`
from root directory.
4. Open directly the `index.html` in root directory to view the output page or start an htpp server (you can do this using `npm run start-http` or using editor extension) from root directory.
